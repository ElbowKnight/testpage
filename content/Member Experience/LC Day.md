> [!abstract] What is an LC Day?
> An **LC Day** is a meeting organised by the MX department, where the whole [[Local Committee - LC]] gathers together to do some activities, as a way of doing team bonding.

It is expected to do around three LC Days during the whole year. However, it can be adapted to necessities and situations.

## Steps to prepare an LC Day
### Step 1. When and where
Sometimes, depending on the activity proposed, it might be only possible to do the activity on certain dates or certain times.
> [!example] Example
> For instance, if an idea for an activity is to go to the cinema, the time restriction is whenever the cinema is open, as well as the location since it can only be done in the cinema.

Usually, it may be better to firstly choose a day where is is certain that most people are okay to do it. A good tool to use may be [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com). The tool, especially if a certain weekend was selected for example, is especially useful since it allows to know when can anyone attend, as well as a percentage of attendance with half hour precision. It is recommended to, at least, choose the date with one or two weeks of margin so that the team can prepare anything that may be needed.

Once a certain date is chosen, now that the team knows the date when everyone (or most of the people) can attend, they can begin planning the LC Day. The main activities for the day are the activities.
### Step 2. Activities planned
Once a date is chosen, it may be useful to choose one or more activities for the day. The reason date and time may be chosen first is because activities may vary depending on it (for instance, perhaps an outdoor picnic would not be the best option is the chosen date is expected to rain).
It may be recommended to try and propose more than one activity, in case somehow the main activity has a problem and it cannot be done. Especially, an activity for each situation may be ideal, although its clear it cannot be always done. For example:
- **Main activity:** The activity we expect to do.
- **Weather-substitute activity:** What if it rains? What if there is fog?
- **Lack of people activity:** What if there are less people than we expected and we cannot make the main activity?
- **Other activities:** What if other conditions happen and we need another alternative?
In practical terms, usually having an activity, and a backup in case that activity cannot be done is enough.
#### Step 2.1. Duration of LC Day
An LC Day does not have a fixed amount of time that it should last. However, it is not expected to last as much as an LC Meeting. A practical rule is to think that an LC Day may last between 90 minutes and 4 hours. It is intended to be a short bonding activity, not an actual whole day of activities.
Usually, the duration should be set depending on the activities that may be planned. A good rule is to approximate activities and round their duration to the half (for example, if you expect an activity to last 20 minutes, round it to 30, if it is expected to last 35, round to 30 minutes), and add 10 minutes between activities. Sometimes other departments may want a small space in the meeting to show everyone about their department, in which case that should also be taken into account.
### Step 3. Communicate the LC Day information officially
Now, we should have location, time, activities and duration. We may sum up in a message everything and send it to the LC group chat, along with a final poll for people to confirm they are coming. Along all this, it is important that, in case you see people not voting, try to text them friendly reminders to their private chat, especially if a whole day already passed. People may just forget about voting, but we do need their confirmation, just in case.
