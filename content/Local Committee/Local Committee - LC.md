In [[AIESEC]] there are several Member Committees (MC from now on, see [[Initialisms]]), each one on a different country. For example, Spain has its own MC, Germany too, Italy too, and so on. Inside each country there are different Local Committees (LCs from now on) for each region. An LC is the lowest committee in terms of both size and hierarchy. As a general rule, they are the ones who coordinate experiences, local accounting and local marketing campaigns.
Each committee has its own [[Departments|departments]], and there is a [[Local committee membership criteria#^b23fe9|minimum amount of departments]] a Local Committee must have.
